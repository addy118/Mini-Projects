Mini-Projects that I have worked on

Mini-Voting System:

This is a C mini-project. In this program, the candidates can be given votes, the votes can be counted, the winner can be shown and the program ends when the user chooses to exit.

Unit Conversion:

This is a C++ mini-project. In this program, the units can be converted in other desired units. The units are categorized nicely. The program ends when the user selects exit.
